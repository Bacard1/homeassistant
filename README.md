Welcome to my Home Assistant repository!
Here you'll find a collection of my personal Home Assistant projects, automations, configurations, and integrations — all carefully developed to simplify daily routines, enhance comfort, and save energy in the smart home environment.
Most projects include support in both English and Bulgarian, and I continuously update the repository with new features and improvements.
